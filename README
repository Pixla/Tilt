ANU COMP1100 Assignment 2011

To make your own level go to "src/levels/default.joseph".

Follow the file format, and then add the filename of the level to "src/levels/levels.sam".

It does support an internet high scores list but I lost the server code, you could probably work out what to send and receive.

Additional map tiles:
0 = Hole 
1 = Floor 
2 = Wall 
3 = Spawn 
4 = Goal 
5 = North Booster
6 = East Booster
7 = South Booster
8 = West Booster
9 = Gate (5 seconds) 
10 = Inverted Gate (5 seconds)
